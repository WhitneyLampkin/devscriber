Pro-tip: look through the github diff between the previous release to see what's changed. The commit titles should give an outline of what's happened.

### Upgrade Steps

- List out, as concretely as possible, any steps users have to take when they upgrade beyond just dumping the dependency.
- Write pseudocode that highlights what code should change and how.
- Call out if users are recommended to upgrade because of known problems with older releases.
- Preferably, there's nothing here.

### Breaking Changes

- A complete list of breaking changes (preferably there are none, unless this is a major version).

### New Features

- Describe the new feature and when/why to use it. Add some pictures! Call out any caveats/warnings? Is it a beta feature?

### Bug Fixes

- Call out any existing feature/functionality that now works as intended or expected.

### Improvements

- Improvements/enhancements to a workflow, performance, logging, error messaging, or user experience

### Other Changes

- Other miscellaneous changes that don't fit into any of the above categories. Try to leave this empty - ideally, all changes fit into the categories above
